# Feldunor
A roguelike and reboot of a project I started a couple years ago.

A simple roguelike written in Rust, using [Shipyard](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard) and [bracket-lib](https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib).

Also made using the help of this [tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) written by the author of bracket-lib.
